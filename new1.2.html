	<div class="aim">
	<p style="font-size: 30px;">What are Science Based Targets?</p>
	<p><BR>Science Based Targets allow organisations to set carbon footprint reductions at the right level to keep Global temperature changes to less than 2oC, as described in the 5th report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Best practice now is to limit temperature the rises to 1.5oC by 2050 and targets are now being set to reach this Climate Change goal.</p><BR><BR>
	<p style="font-size: 30px;">Why Organisations Need Carbon Targets?</p>
	<p><BR>Businesses are responsible for a high proportion of the World’s carbon emissions and from both a practical and ethical stance has a vital role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Science Based Targets encourage businesses to align their carbon footprint reduction aims to take account of a fair share of the climate budget. This also encourages other businesses in their supply chains to do the same.<BR><BR>Having Science Based Targets will also, of course, save operating costs as organisations reduce their energy use. In addition to this, it is visible demonstration that the organisation takes sustainability very seriously, enhancing their brands and value with stakeholders and customers.</p><BR><BR>
	<p style="font-size: 30px;">How to set Targets?</p>
	<p><BR>SThere are 7 target setting methods, which allows businesses to choose targets that take their sector into consideration.</p><BR>
	<p>The Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) is one of these. It has a handy on-line calculation tool (developed by WRI, CDP and WWF) and allocates the 2°C carbon budget to different sectors.</p><BR><BR>
	<p style="font-size: 30px;">How to Achieve the Target?</p>
	<p><BR>Setting the target is relatively easy - the harder aspect is then what strategies and actions you then take to deliver them; e.g. by setting a 40% target by 2050 may seem like you have a mountain to climb. .</p><BR>
	<p>Following a Carbon Footprint Appraisal, we provide a Carbon Target Setting service to</p><BR>
	<ol>
	<li>Determine the scope of carbon reductions that your organisation can feasibly make</li>
	<li>Help you to understand the cost (capex and resource) to achieving this</li>
	<li>Work out how to manage the reduction - e.g. what order, when </li>
	</ol>
	<p style="font-size: 30px;"><BR><BR>How to Benefit From Targets?</p>
	<p><BR>Once you have the targets, use them to drive your carbon management programmes forward - successful implemented should result in reductions in operating costs as well as carbon. </p>
